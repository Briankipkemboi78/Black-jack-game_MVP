Usage
Once you have the game up and running, follow these instructions to play:

Launch the game, and you will be prompted to enter the number of players participating in the game.

Each player will be dealt two cards from a standard 52-card deck.

The objective of the game is to have a hand value as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it.

The value of cards follows standard Blackjack rules: number cards (2-10) are worth their face value, face cards (Jacks, Queens, Kings) are worth 10 points, and Aces can be worth 1 or 11 points, depending on which value is more favorable for the player.

Players will have the option to 'hit' (draw another card) or 'stand' (keep their current hand) in turns until they decide to stand or their hand value exceeds 21 (bust).

The dealer will then reveal their facedown card and draw additional cards according to a predetermined set of rules.

The player with a hand value closest to 21 without exceeding it wins the round.

The game will prompt you if you want to play again or exit.
